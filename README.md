# Moddabilty-as-Accessibility Demonstrations

This is a collection of moddability-as-accessibility demonstrations built in Godot 4.5, to demonstrate how separating game development into a three-service process that is managed by a controller can allow for input and output modules to be replaced and expand greatly user experience.

This design philosophy is intended to be used alongside more classical accessibility solutions to allow for end users to have more ability to customize their user interfaces for their personal needs, especially those that cannot be predicted by developers, or for development projects with too few resources for full extensive accessibility testing and implementation.

## Example projects
- [Smash the Creeps](https://github.com/badgernested/modular-godot/tree/main/smash-the-creeps) - A modification of the Godot demo [Squash the Creeps](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2751) with a modular interface. Note: This example is not designed to be accessible.
- [creeps-exp](https://github.com/badgernested/modular-godot/tree/main/creeps-exp) - A project with multiple external modules developed for the Smash the Creeps demo.
